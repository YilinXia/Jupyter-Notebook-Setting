Customize Jupyter Notebook and Improve your Programming Experience

## Kernels
[Github Kernels](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels)
, a place where people summarized all kernels you are able to add to your jupyter notebook
For daily use, like data analysis, machien learning or deep learning, Python, R and octave could be three main kernels for me to use
